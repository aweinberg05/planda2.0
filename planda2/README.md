Technologies used:
gem ‘devise’
gem ‘materialize-sass’
gem ‘compliments’
gem ‘giphy’
Action Mailer

Approach Taken:
Focusing on our MVP, we started out wireframing every detail around a basic CRUD app. Starting with DEVISE, we created a new Rails App with login security and automatic features. Next, the focus was on creating, reading, updating and deleting for users, teams, comments, and tasks through materialize forms. Giphy and Compliment API gems spice up the User’s view on the individual tasks page. The Spotify widget was added so users can jam out to music while performing the task. Lastly, we focused on user experience and design with Materialize.
